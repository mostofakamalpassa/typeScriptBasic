/* 
    Arrays and tuples
    One flexible and one fixed
    Choose your adventure
    JavaScript arrays are wildly flexible and can hold any mixture of values inside:
*/
const elements = [true, null, undefined, 42];
// elements.push("even", ["more"]);
// Value of elements: [true, null, undefined, 42, "even", ["more"]]
/* 
    In most cases, though, individual JavaScript arrays are intended to hold
only one specific type of value. Adding values of a different type may be
confusing to readers, or worse, the result of an error that could cause
problems in the program.
