/* 
    Nothing is constant
    Values may change over time
    (well, except constants)
*/


/* 

    Unions
Expanding a value’s allowed type to be two or more possible types

    Narrowing
Reducing a value’s allowed type to not be one or more possible types

Put together, unions and narrowing are powerful concepts that allow
TypeScript to make informed inferences on your code many other
mainstream languages cannot.
